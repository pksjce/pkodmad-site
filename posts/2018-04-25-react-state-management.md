Disclaimer - This post assumes you know how to code using React.

Using React brings forth the concept of writing components which are a function of your state. Thus for the first time since MVC, we as React devs are thinking of the state of our application as one entity. This brings with it a discussion of state management.

'State' is any data that you must maintain in your frontend application. Data can arrive in your application in the form of

1.  Static data/json or arrays you define in your components.
2.  Data fetched from a backend api resource or an external source like localStorage or sessionStorage
3.  Data used to maintain the UI itself. Is a modal open? Is the request successful/loading or failed. Is the mouse button clicked? Has window been resized?

This data can change with user interaction or with more api interactions. Changed data must be displayed to the user reliably and accurately.

When it comes to abstracting these functionalities into convenient constructs, we have a ton of libraries do this for us in various different ways. At first glance, it might appear to be chaos but each of the libraries exists to solve a specific problem that users may encounter while working on React applications, following a specific pattern in React land.

### What does a state management solution give you?

After trying out various solutions, comparing and contrasting them, I've distilled the manifestation of state management into a handful of requirements. When talking about state management libraries we will see how they fare with respect to these properties.

1.  Provide a state container - We must have a place to put our state. The more central this place is, the easier it is to share it among components, to reason about changes and to have a clear idea about it in our minds.
2.  Allow components to individially select state that is relevant to them - Each component must be allowed to subscribe to state that it requires to render itself effectively.An update to the state must inform all its Subscriber components of the change. The change must trigger a re-render of these components.
3.  A mechanism to update state - Each component must be able to affect change in the state in a reasonable manner, preferably in an immutable way.
4.  Make asynchronous calls or handle other sideeffects - A component must be able to perform asynchronous actions like api calls or timed updates and the state container must respond in a uniform manner to this. It must be able to update state after with the result of the asynchronous action and then affect re-render in the concerned components.
5.  Support for middleware - This essentially decides if the state management tool has decent dev-tools support. A nice to have feature if you ask me.

## React Component State

This is the default mechanism provided by React to work with state inside of a component. It is recommended that you start your work by using this and see how much you can control your application using React state alone!

### How's it done?

A functional React component is stateless. It can only recieve props from its parent components. A React component that inherits from `React.Component` can hold state as a class property. This state can be updated using the method `setState` only. `setState` will update the `state` object and effect a re-render of the component it self.

```javascript
import React from "react";

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    inputText: ""
  };
  render() {
    <input
      type="text"
      onChange={event => this.setState({ inputText: event.target.value })}
      value={this.state.inputText}
    />;
  }
}
```

| ------------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State Container    | ðŸ¤·  | State container inside the component. Must be passed as props to other components in the tree.                                                            |
| Selector           | ðŸ™Š  | No support. The child component will receive props that it may not need as it is being passed to other parts of the tree                                  |
| Updater            | ðŸ™Š  | The component itself calls `setState` to make the update. Other components have to supplied a callback that will do this in the state contained component |
| Async support      | âš’   | This is mostly DIY.                                                                                                                                       |
| Middleware support | ðŸ›    | Can be DIY or use the React dev tools which are not specific to state management.                                                                         |

## Redux

Redux has been around for quite [some time](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/commit/8bc14659780c044baac1432845fe1e4ca5123a8d) now. It's one of the most widely used state management system and one that I'm most familiar with. It has been loved and hated by the community in equal parts! But it has managed to stay as the top choice for state management because

1.  It is a simple solution.
2.  It is flexible enough to meet the needs of the most complex application.
3.  It was one of the first of such solutions.
4.  it follows the flux pattern of one directiional update of React
5.  There is a wealth of resources around it like middleware and documentation. Most of the problems that you may encounter while using Redux has been solved to a well documented pattern.

The flow of data is easy to visualize as
interaction -> action -> reducer -> store update -> refresh connected component

To provide us with this cognitive simplicity, redux relies on a some boilerplate. A store has tobe created in the very beginning. Middleware, and external dependencies have to be declared at this point. A set of reducers have to be defined and combined to a single root reducer. An action has to be created in an action creator. It must have a type and payload. Actions and state data have to be "connect"ed to a component so that state is available for usage and actions are avaialble for dispatch. Each action must be handled in a reducer inside a switch case. The case must update the state slice that is part of the reducer in an immutable way. Furthermore, selectors must be used to access state values from the store.

All this can seem really unnecessary when you really dont need that degree of flexibility. Many times, users may be happy with a more restricted state management solution than one with so much indirection.

| ------------------ | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State Container    |     | Store is the container that keeps all the state and other methods such as dispatch. You can access the state using the getState method. A component can use the react-redux bindings to access the part of the state tree it is most interested in. |
| Selector           |     | Can use a method that returns the required state or some composable memoizable solution such as reselect.                                                                                                                                           |
| Updater            |     | A component dispatches an action which is captured in a reducer to update the state, which triggers a re render of the component which is concerned with the data change.                                                                           |
| Async support      |     | Provides first class support using middleware with options like thunk/redux-observable/redux-saga                                                                                                                                                   |
| Middleware support |     | Again first class support. Thus making for beautiful and interactive dev tools with support for debugging and time travel.                                                                                                                          |

### So many new libraries.

In the very recent times, state management has again become a topic of much discussion and a bunch of new libraries have erupted promising to make away with all the boilerplate, yet provide a smooth state management solution.

The reason, I think for this rise can be attributed to

1.  The new React context api - After the complete rewrite of the react internals, the react team revisited the much debated context api. This api is the way react recommends we update state by "jumping" the react render tree and exchange data between the only components conceerned with the state. The earlier version of the api was not a stable one and not recommended by the core team. However, the api was drastically changed with the community's help using this [RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-new-version-of-context.md).
2.  The rise of render-props - At one point in time, the only way to decorate functionality over a react component by libraries was through Higher-Order-components(HOC). This method was proven to be not so flexible and after much debate replaced in many places using the render-props pattern. [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcVAq3YFiuc) is a great resource to learn all about it.Redux and many of the previous solutions advocated the HOC way of doing things.

The above both practices started a new round of experiments in State management libraries. I will illustrate two of them here.

1.  [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)
    Unstated is perhaps the simplest utility wrapper over React's context api. It is tiny, gives a great api and does this as close to the "metal" that is React. It makes a single important design choice of using `setState` api to update state in it's "store"
    Unstated works by providing three primitives to manage state globally in your React application.
    `Provider` - This is the component that needs to wrap around the top of your application and gives state as context to all the components within it.
    `Container` - This is the "store" abstraction that it provides. It is a class you extend, to store your state and house the methods that update this state. All state can be updated only using `this.setState`. This behaves exactly as it would in a React component but at a global level.
    `Consumer` - The consumer receives the state from the container in the form of render properties. It also receives the methods specified in the container.

This is a non-trivial example I created to see the full usage of Unstated.

| ------------------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| State Container    |     | Provides a container api to store state globally                                                             |
| Selector           |     | DIY. Can access state directly. Selectors wont stop component from rerendering when unrelated state changes. |
| Updater            |     | Simple method calls which use `setState` to update state container data.                                     |
| Async support      |     | Completely DIY.                                                                                              |
| Middleware support |     | None. However, there is a hook provided for dev tools.                                                       |

2.  [React-copy-write](https://github.com/aweary/react-copy-write)

In the same sprit of using render properties and the new React context, there exists another library, which makes a different design decision for state update. It uses the immutable library `immer` which gives it a nice guarantee of always updating state immutably. Another advantage to this library is that it provides a selector pattern which prevents unnecessary re-renders in React compoenents.
In the library, you can create a State object using `createState` api by providing it the shape of your state. The State object then destructures into a `Provider`, `Consumer` and a `createMutator` method.
To see a full usage of this library, refer to this sandbox.

### What am I skipping?

My main aim with this article is to illustrate at a high level, what everybody talks about when they discuss state management and why there are this many solutions to do it. It is a subjective matter of taste and opinion when it comes to choosing a state management library.
I also dont talk much about some other very popular solutions like mobx and cerebral. This is mostly because I have not worked with them as closely as those I have described in this article.
One other thing that I'm not speaking about here is the existence of graphql. WIth the new popularity of graphql and its query api, there is a push to do local and remote state management using relay or apollo. They are increasing support for state management solutions day by day. This is definitely a space to watch out for and there are many consumers who love this solution for their apps.
