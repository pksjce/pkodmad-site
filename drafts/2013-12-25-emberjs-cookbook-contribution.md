I finally made an OSS contribution on Emberjs website! Its very exciting to finally do it after months of contemplation. The cookbook, I found is a great place to start. Mainly because, I am not very sure of my Ember expertise. By volunteering to write tiny snippets of best practice methods in Ember, I immediately should get feedback on what I'm doing wrong.  
With this particular merge, I learnt that --setTimeout is not required inside Ember at all. Ember.run.later does the same thing.--

So here's the link to [My first contribution](http://emberjs.com/guides/cookbook/helpers_and_components/spin_button_for_asynchronous_actions/). May I be blessed with many more!
